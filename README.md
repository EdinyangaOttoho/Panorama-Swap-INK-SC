# Welcome to Panorama Swap's smart contract repository!

In this repositroy you'll find every smart contract we are using in Panorama Swap platform.
We are using ink! domain specific language to write smart contract for networks that run Substrate framework and ink! contracts are compiled to WebAssembly.
We are following and implementing OpenBrush's PSP22 protocol and standard.

*We are continually updating and adding more smart contracts and in-depth information, stay tuned :) 

#### Contracts :

1. pair_creation - a contract to deploy and create trading_pair_azero and trading_pair_psp22 in order for users to create their own liquidity pools and trading pairs. 

2. psp22 - a contract that implements OpenBrush's PSP22 standard to create PSP22 tokens with metadata extension (token name and symbol).

3. trading_pair_azero - this contract is used in deploying AZERO/PSP22 trading pairs and pools.

4. trading_pair_psp22 - this contract is used in deploying PSP22/PSP22 trading pairs and pools.
